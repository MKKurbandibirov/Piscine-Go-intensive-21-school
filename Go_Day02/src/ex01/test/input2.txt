People in Great Britain like animals. There are even special hospitals, which help wild animals. There
are a lot of television films about wildlife. They are very popular with children and grown ups. A lot
of British families have 'bird tables' in their gardens. Birds can eat from them during the winter
months. The 'bird table' should be high because cats can eat birds.

The British often think their animals are like people. For example in Britain animals can have jobs like
people. British Rail has cats and pays them for their work. Their job is to catch mice. There is usually
one cat per station. They get food and free medical help. The cats don't catch a lot of mice but they
are very popular with the British Rail staff and travellers.
